History Channel – The Invention of the Internet
	Before the mid-1960s it was not fathomed that the internet would become what it has today. The idea of the internet was founded upon the original ARPANET that was created in the 1960s. The usage of the computers became more common in the 1960s due to a national security concern of Soviet threats and the need to be a step ahead of this potential threat. This usage of computers was mainly driven by graduate students in colleges on the West Coast, then the usage of ARPANET saw a very real potential to improve the telephone communications from the circuits that were currently being used, these circuits were unreliable and could be cut off. One of these thoughts of communications improvements came from being able to send information using packets and a packet network, a packet was a comprised of data files to send to different computers, or better known as Interface Message Processors (IMPs). The building and sharing of networks began to become a reality in the late 1960s that boosted the idea of resource sharing using a terminal to communicate with other computers. It should be known that the BBN worked within the ARPANET to set up packet switching to determine how far these packets could go and how they would get to their destination. In 1969 the first pieces of hardware computers were link, later the IMP was transported to UCLA to test packet sharing, which turned out to be a success. Improvements were necessity at this point and one of those improvements was a “killer app” which is what we know today as e-mail! The code that eventually became the bones for today’s email was invented by Raymond Tomlinson. Although the growth in linking these hardware pieces of computers and the development of email occurred of a span of few years no major improvements regarding the internet were seen for in over 20 years apart from increasing memory on chips. Later on, we would see what would unfold into the structure of the internet we know today as the ARPANET was mostly used for government, we see in 1992 that the internet was allowed to become public. 
The True Story of the Internet – Browser Wars
	At its roots the internet, then known as the ARPANET, was not intended for use by people outside of colleges and the government, but as time went by and we descended into the 1990s, it was clear that the internet needed to become a global network. Tim Benrers-Lee wanted to make the internet public and accessible for all. After the internet was able to become public, in 1993 one of the first internet browsers for public use was developed for easy searching, it was known as Mosaic, then it became known as Netscape. This development of browsers incited major competition between companies to have the best functioning browsers. As Netscape grew, and it grew quickly it became obvious to Microsoft, the PC giant of the early 1980s and 1990s, that Netscape was a threat to their current state as the number one technology company. It became increasingly obvious that Netscape was not threatened by Microsoft and was becoming more competitive. Microsoft had MSN but had been moving slowly to keep up at the pace that Netscape was developing, Netscape was easily downloadable and was easy to use. Netscape became an “internet tidal wave” and through Microsoft they were a threat that needed to be taken out. Microsoft had even met with the creators of Netscape and offered them $1 million to buy them out, Netscape declined which caused Microsoft to start copying Netscape’s browser updates. 
The feud between Netscape and Microsoft became intense, where the creators of Netscape would taunt and talk down about Microsoft which only fueled Microsoft to move faster and develop a browser that would take out Netscape.  It was then that Microsoft launched the early form of their Internet Explorer browser, this was a major move by Microsoft to catch up to Netscape and essentially remove them as competition. Microsoft had an advantage that Netscape did not have, which was that most companies operated using PCs with Microsoft Windows installed as the OS. This allowed for Microsoft salesmen to incorporate Internet Explorer into entire package of PCs, as well as threatening to cancel their customer’s subscriptions to Microsoft. This left Netscape in a huge disadvantage where they needed revenue whereas Microsoft’s revenue came from their Microsoft sales that included Internet Explorer in the packages. Microsoft and more specifically Bill Gates began to take down any competitors that came in the way of their sales thus inciting the browser wars of the early 1990s. By 1997 Microsoft had essentially defeated Netscape in the browser war having Internet Explorer as the leading browser on PCs. Netscape was later acquired by America Online (AOL). 
The US Government was able to sue Microsoft for essentially using techniques that copied Netscape’s versions of their browser and incorporated it into Internet Explorer, which was cheating and theft. Bill Gates was considered at the time to be a type of technological “terrorist”, this lawsuit humbled the large company, stating that Microsoft had taken advantage of their position and was then ordered to have Microsoft be broken down into segments. That order was then rescinded and that lessened the blow to Microsoft, after this Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and pursued more humanitarian roles. 
The True Story of the Internet – Internet Search 
	There is a reason by Google became the most successful search engine company and beat out all the rest. Before Google emerged on the scenes in the 1990s, other web browsers had emerged and found success. The major aspect of the success of some of these web browsers were through banner ads as they needed collect revenue. Some of these companies that emerged before Google were those such as Yahoo and Excite. 
	In the 1990s, if you did not study computers or had extensive time to sit down and explore a computer, it was difficult to locate and learn information. There had to be a quicker way for people to be able to search for information and have it at the end of the fingertips. Thus, began search engines, search engines such as Yahoo and Excite were able to pull information from websites and link them together. It was then seen that the internet and the usage of the internet was rapidly changing. As Yahoo and Excite started off as search browsers, it became clear to these companies that revenue was needed and a way to get revenue was to have the web pages support ads. Some of these ads were seen as banner ads and some of them as pop up ads. It was described in the video that some of these websites looked like Time Square at night with strobing lights. Consumers started to see the internet in a different way and the internet was no longer a tool for those who know how to search information but became an important part of everyday life. 
	Enter Google to the picture, a noticeably young company that emerged to the seen that found a way to incorporate easy searching by way of finding links with the most “hits” and tallying those websites with the most “hits” in order. While the process of finding these links were easy for the creators of Google, thy had trouble finding revenue as they didn’t want to add banners of ads to the Google website, so they needed to find a way to make revenue. Luckily for Google at the start up there were many venture capitalists that offered Google money to form their search engine. The Google creators landed on Bill Gross’ idea where he and created a type of Internet “Yellow pages” in sponsored listings. The idea was to incorporate ads that are not blatantly in the consumer’s face, Google wanted to incorporate a more tactful way to support ads. After this Google was sued by Bill Gross, they were able to settle down on agreement and Google was able to start to make money using sponsored listings. 
	Google began to quickly grow as the best search engine on the market, they went public in 2004 and fears then began to grow that Google would “know too much”, which is something that still stands to be true today. 
The True Story of the Internet – The Dot Com Bubble
	Ecommerce began to hit the internet in the late 1990s, which was the start of the first internet shopping addiction which aided capitalism. The dominating companies of the late 1990s were Amazon and eBay. Both websites started as small websites to sell books, and to place bids. Jeff Bezos and Pierre Omidyar, the creators of Amazon and eBay respectively started up their companies out of their homes, little did they know that this would revolutionize consumerism. Jeff Bezos and Pierre Omidyar had different approaches in how their businesses would develop. Pierre Omidyar did not have any business plans, was unorganized and wanted to build an auction website, whereas Jeff Bezos was very analytical, and did his research on the market. Both companies boomed in grown and quickly caught the eye of Wall Street analysts that online shopping would change the way consumers shopped. 
	Moore’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law were big aspects that paved the way to online consumerism. Moore’s Law states that microprocessors and memory chips double every 18 months which have allowed for computers to shrink over time. Metcalfe’s Law states that essentially 2 users equal 1 connection, 4 users equals 6 connections and so on. As the number of users increases the more useful the network becomes and allows for more users to join. As the number of more consumers increased the more need for privacy and security as consumers paid with their credit cards. This allowed for the development of encryption and public key cryptography were made which allowed for more growth and consumers.
	As the dot com bubble increased, more and more venture capitalists poured their money in many different companies in hopes that at least one or two of these websites would be successful and they would make money off them. Because of this new sensation, analysts in Wall Street were unfamiliar to this and therefore unaware of the bubble that was rising and what to do when this bubble popped. For example, Jeff Bezos put his customers first and continued to lower prices for customers as competitive rates, he stood by his mantra to “Get Big Fast”, and that did in fact happen for Amazon. This dot com bubble also allowed for people to become day traders and trade stocks from their own homes, something that was not seen before. In parallel to the dot com bubble was the telecommunications bubble where companies were spending too much money and building too many networks to quickly. On Black Friday, the Nasdaq dropped by 355 points, effectively placing the blame on Wall Street. 
The True Story of the Internet – People	
	After the dot com bubble there was a huge uprising in communications and how to effectively communicate using the internet. This allows for a new innovation of internet to come and take over. This allowed people to communicate and contribute to the internet personally. 
	Major companies at the time wanted to change the way that the internet operated by giving more power to regular people and giving those people a voice. We saw that rise with emerging companies such as YouTube, Myspace and Digg. Youtube’s slogan was “Broadcast Yourself” which they held true to bringing more personalized internet and allowed users more freedom to create. The company Digg wanted to bring words from the public to their website as opposed to only reading published news articles and journals. Myspace allowed for creators to have a personalized area for social media, allowing people to view their page as their “bedroom”, something incredibly personal. 
	Social media platforms boomed during this time, which changed the way people communicated, with the rise of Facebook and Myspace. Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook used a unique way to use social media, he used what he called a social graph concept where people are connected by a web of others they may be connected to. This era brought so much individually and really shaped and paved the way that we used the internet today. 
	Music was an industry that did not give too much though the rise of the internet, that all changed when mp3 sharing platforms such as Napster emerged and allowed music to be shared quickly to consumers for free. Napster was a shift in how the music industry would shape the way they operate in the future. Shawn Fanning, a college student, created Napster to be shared amongst his college friends, and almost overnight Napster was shared and became a sensation. People on Napster were able to communicate with one another and share their music along this platform. The Recording Industry of Association of America saw Napster as a threat and asked Napster to remove all copyrighted music from their website. Musicians spoke out against Napster which only attracted more users to Napster. Napster was then summoned in lawsuits the RIAA brought up and were later shut down, this gave rise to iTunes by Apple. However, this was short sighted as more music sharing platforms would Another company that came into play during this era was Viacom against YouTube, it was found that people were preferring to spend their time on YouTube as opposed to watching television, which was threatening to companies like Viacom. 

It is interesting that the internet is made up of processes using unique IP addresses to send packets of data through, and that packets do not all have to be sent at once but can be broken up and sent on different paths.
